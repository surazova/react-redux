How does React Work? </br>
-Components are the driving force behind react 
-We create components for different parts of our application 
-React takes these components and injects them into the DOM
-Once React takes the virtual DOM, it renders it into the browser 
-The virtual DOM makes it so that React works quickly. 
-It's constantly updating in the DOM

Components and Templates: 
-Components look like HTML templates (actually JSX) 
-They can contain 'state' (data or UI state)
-They can also contain Javascript for functionality
